Create a mini version of CRAN containing only selected packages.

## Introduction

At the end of 2014, CRAN consisted of more than 6,000 packages, and by 2017 this number doubled to more than 12,000.  Many organisations need to maintain a private mirror of CRAN, but with only a subset of packages that are relevant to them.

The `miniCRAN` package makes it possible to create an internally consistent repository consisting of selected packages from CRAN-like repositories.  The user specifies a set of desired packages, and `miniCRAN` recursively reads the dependency tree for these packages, then downloads only this subset.  

## Important functions:

Function           | Use it for
--------------     | ------------------------------------------
`pkgDep()`         | Find package dependencies
`makeRepo()`       | Make repository (with or without downloading packages)
`addPackage()`     | Add additonal packages (and their dependencies) to existing repository
`updatePackages()` | Update the versions of packages currently in the repository

## Installation:

Get the stable version from CRAN:

```r
install.packages("miniCRAN")
library("miniCRAN")
```

### Development version

Get the latest development version from github:

```r
# Use `devtools` to install directly from github
library(devtools)
install_github("andrie/miniCRAN")
```

### System requirements

The `miniCRAN` package itself doesn't introduce any system dependencies.  However, the package imports the  [`curl`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=curl) and [`XML`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=XML) packages. These have system requirements on `libxml2-devel`, `libcurl-devel` and `openssl-devel`.

* On systems with the `rpm` package manager (Red Hat, CentOS) try:

```bash
yum install libcurl-devel libxml2-devel openssl-devel
```

* On systems with the `aptitude` package manager (Debian, Ubuntu) try:

```bash
apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev libxml2-devel openssl-devel
```

    
## Example:

```r
# Determine and download the packages `ggplot2`, `plyr` and `reshape2`, 
# including their dependencies:

library("miniCRAN")
pkgs <- c("ggplot2", "plyr", "reshape2")
makeRepo(pkgDep(pkgs), path = file.path(tempdir(), "miniCRAN"))
```
